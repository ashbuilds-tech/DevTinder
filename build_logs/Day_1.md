# Day 1

## What did I do?

- Created a folder and initialized an empty node project.
- Created a `server.js` file and wrote a simple server using `http` module
- Installed express and setup a server in `express`
- Added middlewares : `json` and `urlencoded` provided by `express`
- Wrote a `GET` request handler for path `/` which provides a `200 OK` status code and sends data in json 

```javascript
{
    "data": "Hello World"
}
```

- Created a git repository in local and pushed to Github
